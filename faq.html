    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div style="width:800px; border-collapse: separate;">
        <B>Why is there no light curve data for some of the sources listed in the main page table? </B><BR>
        The light curve repository (LCR) provides flux estimates at three different cadences for >1500 sources that are deemed variable in the 10-year Fermi-LAT point source catalog data release 2 (4FGL-DR2), that is, with a variability index above 21.67. While the table in the  <a href="https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/LightCurveRepository/">main page</a> lists all 4FGL-DR2 sources, only the ones with variability index above 21.67 show embedded hyperlinks to the data products of the source.

        <B>Can I download the light curves of more than one source at the time?</B><BR>
        You could use scripts like <a href="download.py">this one</a> to that end.
        
        <BR><BR>
        <B>Is it possible to fix the pop out charts that appear when I hover over a source in the map? They disappear before I can click on the links within them.</B><BR>
        Double clicking on the desired source in the map will fix the chart.
